# Readme

We here show how to compare latent factor models and psychometric network models using the [R package Psychonetrics (Epskamp, 2019)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/psychonetrics/psychonetrics.pdf). 

The material here accompanies the paper [Kan, K.J., de Jonge, H., van der Maas, H.L.J., Levine, S.Z., & Epskamp, S. (2020). How to Compare Latent Factor Models and Psychometric Network Models. *Journal of Intelligence*](https://github.com/KJKan/mcfarland/blob/master/jintelligence-844295.pdf).

Our [tutorial](https://github.com/KJKan/mcfarland/blob/master/Tutorial.md) illustrates how
-  A network can be extracted from the data from one sample and fitted on the data of another sample. 
     - in other words, how to test if a given network *replicates*
- The fit statistics of that network can be compared with the fit statistics of (various) factor models. 

The factor models that are fitted are those that were considered by [McFarland (2020)](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-3200/8/1/7/htm):
- A measurement model                                           
- A (second order) g model                                                    
- A bifactor model                                                       

The data concern WAIS-IV US validation sample data and WAIS-IV Hungary validation sample data.
