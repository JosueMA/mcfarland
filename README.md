We here show how to compare latent factor models and psychometric network models using the R package Psychonetrics (Epskamp, 2019). 

The material here accompanies the paper Kan, K.J., de Jonge, H., van der Maas, H.L.J., Levine, S.Z., & Epskamp, S. (2020). How to Compare Latent Factor Models and Psychometric Network Models. *Journal of Intelligence*.

Our tutorial illustrates how
-  A network can be extracted from the data from one sample and fitted on the data of another sample. 
     - in other words, how to test if a given network *replicates*
- The fit statistics of that network can be compared with the fit statistics of (various) factor models. 

The factor models that are fitted are those that were considered by McFarland (2020):
- A measurement model                                           
- A (second order) g model                                                    
- A bifactor model                                                       

The data concern WAIS-IV US validation sample data and WAIS-IV Hungary validation sample data.
